# Persian_Sentiment_Analysis
Sentiment analysis done on Persian food comments using custom built functions

This program was originally related to a startup idea that led to foundation of Bejoor team but was later used for some other programs and clients
Persian sentence cleaner libraries were mostly out of date and not in sync with their necessary libraries during the process of my work and mostly inefficient which led to me creating several cleaner functions from scratch for Persian sentences
The strength of this program is that it works with the basic libraries and almsot doesn't have any dependencies
There are variants to the cleaner function each able to work on certain inputs.The ptq cleaner works on input sentences and lists while the functions inside sentiment analysis works on csv and cleaner python file can be used with postman
the .joblib files are also uploaded but the code snippet to dump them using joblib library are also in the Persian sentiment analysis notebook
